# Why shouldn't we build social housing in Hanoi nor Ho Chi Minh City?
This just a random thought.

Usually, we have discussion about building social housing in cities and provices such as: Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh city (HCM city), Hai Phong,... While for industrial center such as Hai Phong, it makes sense to build cheap houses for worker or low income classes, it doesn't really suitable for services-focus economy such as Hanoi or HCM city. 

From period 2013 to 2023, structure of Hanoi's economy change from industry from service, with average growth of industry is ?? vs ?? for services. This could be a representation for longer trend of movement of these two cities. This leads us to question who should we build social housing for ?

Should we utilize real estate of developing social housing for better economy purpose such as commercial center?
